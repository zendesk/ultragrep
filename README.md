ultragrep
=========

ultragrep is a grep tool, written at Zendesk, that works with multiple
AND'ed regular expressions across multi-line requests and across multiple files.

huh?
====

Some examples:

let's say we have a production.log request that logs like this:

    Rewriting API request from /users/123.xml to /api/v1/users/123.xml
    Processing Api::V1::UsersController#show to xml (for 99.99.99.99 at 2013-06-04 23:55:19) [GET]
      Parameters: {"controller"=>"api/v1/users", "action"=>"show", "id"=>"123", "format"=>"xml"}
    Filter chain halted as [:authenticate_user] rendered_or_redirected.
    API request mode:web, subdomain:foo, lotus:no, mobile:false, time:2, account_id:68745, user:, url:https://foo.zendesk.com/api/v1/users/123.xml
    Completed in 7ms (View: 1, DB: 0) | 401 Unauthorized [https://foo.zendesk.com/api/v1/users/123.xml]

The following ultragrep commands go like the following:

    ultragrep foo.zendesk.com                 -> match
    ultragrep foo.zendesk.com frozzbozzle     -> no match, foo.zendesk.com is there but frozzbozzle is not
    utlragrep foo.zendesk.com UsersController -> match, both terms were satisfied (though on different lines)
    ultragrep api/v1/users/\d+\.xml           -> full perl-compatible-regular-expression support

Setup
=====

Store your logs in this structure:

`/custom/host/name.log-<date> # <date> is 20130102 for 2013-01-02`

define `/etc/ultragrep.yml`:

```Yaml
types:
  app:
    glob: "/custom/*/production.log-*"
    format: "app"
default_type: app
```

for rails, it's highly advised to use ActiveSupport::BufferedLogger for your web requests, so as to prevent them
from interleaving.  There's ways to pick out web requests from interleaved logs, but it's not pretty.


Usage
=====

<!-- copy paste ./bin/ultragrep -h result -->
```
Usage: ultragrep [OPTIONS] [REGEXP ...]

Dates: all datetimes are in UTC whatever Ruby's Time.parse() accepts.
For example '2011-04-30 11:30:00'.

Options are:
    -h, --help                       This text
        --version                    Show version
    -c, --config FILE                Config file location (default: .ultragrep.yml, ~/.ultragrep.yml, /etc/ultragrep.yml)
    -p, --progress                   show grep progress to STDERR
    -v, --verbose                    DEPRECATED
    -t, --tail                       Tail requests, show matching requests as they arrive
    -l, --type TYPE                  Search type of logs, specified in config
        --perf                       Output just performance information
    -d, --day DATETIME               Find requests that happened on this day
    -b, --daysback  COUNT            Find requests from COUNT days ago to now
    -o, --hoursback COUNT            Find requests  from COUNT hours ago to now
    -s, --start DATETIME             Find requests starting at this date
    -e, --end DATETIME               Find requests ending at this date
        --host HOST                  Only find requests on this host

Note about dates: all datetimes are in UTC, and are flexibly whatever ruby's
Time.parse() will accept.  the format '2011-04-30 11:30:00' will work just fine, if you
need a suggestion.
```

Examples
========

To tail work-server logs for XYZJob

```Bash
ultragrep -t -l work XYZJob
```

To look at logs from last two days for 'host.com' and foobar

```Bash
ultragrep -b 2 host.com foobar
```
